  - describe the example files


## Running `kipoi predict` on new data

  - Running models on your own data:
    - Replace the path to the bed file and the reference genome (single chromosome)
      - [ ] TODO - provide some known enhancer regions - upload data to S3
  - try out differenet output formats
    - hdf5 - h5 ls
  - loading in parallel
  - add GPU dependencies

- Use snakemake to use 3 different models
  - common environments
  - kipoi env get
- Analyze the common results
